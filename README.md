# HGF-Helper

❗ This README describes **version 2** of the extension.  
If you're looking for the README of version 1, you can find it [here](./readme/v1/README.md).  

To upgrade to the latest version, see the [Update instructions](#-update).


## 📘 Overview
A Chrome extension that adds automation and smart enhancements for the `.tv/hitsquadgodfather`, `.tv/hitsquadbruno`, `.tv/hitsquadvito` and `.tv/hitsquadcarlo` channels, as well as the Stream Elements game store.


## 🆕 What's New in Version 2

Here’s what’s changed compared to version 1:

1. 🔐 **Twitch-based authentication**  
   Extension features now use Twitch login for access.  
   This allows you to instantly access your personal settings from any browser — with just one click.  
   See [Privacy details](./readme/PRIVACY.md) for more information.

2. 🗃️ **No more JSONBin setup**  
   A JSONBin account is no longer required to store hidden offers.  
   The extension now handles data storage for you automatically.

    The extension now monitors the status of the mini-games bot and automatically pauses participation if the bot is not responding.

4. 🎨 **Complete UI redesign**  
   The entire extension has been visually refreshed.  
   The new interface is compatible with both light and dark themes on Twitch and StreamElements, and it automatically adapts to the current site theme.

5. 🧩 **Updated extension icon**  
   The browser action icon has been modernized to better fit the new look.

6. 🛠️ **Major codebase refactor**  
   Many internal modules have been restructured and cleaned up for better maintainability and performance.
